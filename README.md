        imageOfTruck: "www.truckimages.com",
        cuisineType: "hi",
        departureTime: null,
        latitude: 1.323,

## Note regarding token and role restrictions as of 2/3/2021, ~6:00 PM: 
I am not running token and role checks on the backend endpoints, because my frontend team was 
having trouble getting their axiosWithAuth to send the token returned by the login POST request above. 
So they are taking care of Authorization by means of private routing â€” i.e., they are simply setting the token 
returned by a successful login to localStorage, and then checking for the presence or absence of that token with a 
<PrivateRoute path="/path" component={componentName} /> for all their restricted components. 
So, again, at present there are no token or role checks on the back-end, which means that they do not at present 
need to run axiosWithAuth on the restricted data endpoints; however, it is possible that, if we get the front-end 
axiosWithAuth working for our team, I will add back in the token and role restrictions on the back end.

## Notable recent changes and additions, 2/3/2021, ~10:00 PM:
- Everything now returns and expects `latitude` and `longitude` *not* `lat` and `lng`, as in previous version. 

- Latitude and longitude may now be floats instead of ints.

- `truckName` is now a property of all trucks, but it may be null, to preserve the integrity of existing data.

- menus section added above
