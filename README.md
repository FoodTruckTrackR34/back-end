## Truck Ratings

### Note: it is assumed that rating *scale* will be determined and enforced client-side. That is, as they are currently set up, these endpoints could work for any integer rating scale (i.e., x out of 5, x out of 10, etc.).

### /api/trucks/add-rating [POST]
For adding a rating to a truck with a truck_id specified in the request body. Expects,
```
{
    "truck_id": [int],
    "user_id": [int],
    "rating": [int]
}
```
Where user_id is the id of the user submitting the rating. Returns a success message.

### /api/trucks/get-all-truck-ratings [GET]
For getting all truck ratings and associated data. Expects no input. Returns an array, like this,
```
[
    {
        "truckRatings_id": 3,
        "rating": 8,
        "truck_id": 3,
        "user_id": 1
    },
    {
        "truckRatings_id": 4,
        "rating": 6,
        "truck_id": 3,
        "user_id": 3
    },
]
```

### /api/trucks/get-truck-rating-avg [GET]
For getting the average rating (rounded) of all trucks. Labeled by truck_id. Returns an array, formatted like this,
```
[
    {
        "avgRating": 7,
        "truck_id": 3
    },
    {
        "avgRating": 3,
        "truck_id": 6
    }
]
```
with both avgRating and truck_id being integers.

## Note regarding token and role restrictions as of 2/3/2021, ~6:00 PM: 
I am not running token and role checks on the backend endpoints, because my frontend team was 
having trouble getting their axiosWithAuth to send the token returned by the login POST request above. 
So they are taking care of Authorization by means of private routing â€” i.e., they are simply setting the token 
returned by a successful login to localStorage, and then checking for the presence or absence of that token with a 
<PrivateRoute path="/path" component={componentName} /> for all their restricted components. 
So, again, at present there are no token or role checks on the back-end, which means that they do not at present 
need to run axiosWithAuth on the restricted data endpoints; however, it is possible that, if we get the front-end 
axiosWithAuth working for our team, I will add back in the token and role restrictions on the back end.

## Notable recent changes and additions, 2/3/2021, ~10:00 PM:
- Everything now returns and expects `latitude` and `longitude` *not* `lat` and `lng`, as in previous version. 

- Latitude and longitude may now be floats instead of ints.

- `truckName` is now a property of all trucks, but it may be null, to preserve the integrity of existing data.

- Menus section added above

## Notable recent changes and additions, 2/4/2021, ~7:15 PM:
- There is now no longer a unique constraint for the `truckImage` url string

- `departureTime` has been renamed to `departureTimeString` and now accepts a string

- Truck Ratings section added above

- The main trucks get request, `/api/trucks [GET]`, now includes the property `user_id`, which is the user_id of the truck's operator.
